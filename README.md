# Bakery Project

### By &rew Peterson

## Description
This is my week 8 Epicodus project using C#.  It is an app for a bakery that allows you to input how many pastries you'd like and how many loaves of bread you would like.  It applies discounts depending on how many items you get and returns the total price.

## Specs
| Behavior | Input  | Output  |
|---|---|---|
| buy 1 loaf of bread |  1  |  5  |
| buy 3 loaves of bread (buy 2 get one free) |  3  |  10  |
| buy 1 pastry  |  1  |  2  |
| buy 3 Pastry (buy 3 for 5) |  3  |  5  |
